Evidence of moderate superficial varicose veins of the leg extending till the   lower third of the thigh. Obvious signs of venous incompetence affecting the GSV with the presence of couple large incompetent perforators. No superficial or deep venous thrombosis.

('Doppl. Penile TRIPLEX STUDY OF THE PENILE VESSELS1','Doppl. Penile TRIPLEX STUDY OF THE PENILE VESSELS1','CLINICAL:

FINDINGS:

The ultrasound and color doppler study showed normal blood signal from 
the dorsal penile arteries with although asymmetrical doppler signal 
weaker on the left side, but still satisfactory reaching 20 cm / sec. the 
doppler spectral traces showed normal high resistence pattern.

The deep cavernous arterial flow is very weak showing a maximum velocity 
of 7 cm / sec bilaterally.

The ultrasound pattern of the deep arteries is normal, they measure 0.8 
mm caliber and looks patent.

No obvious anomalies of the venous flow.

CONCLUSION:  

No obvious arterial obstruction but weak arterial flow in the 
deep penile arteries, justifying a study after prostin injection.

('Doppler arterial lower limbs TRIPLEX ARTERIAL STUDY OF THE LOWER LIMBS1','TRIPLEX ARTERIAL STUDY OF THE LOWER LIMBS:','CLINICAL:

FINDINGS:

Mild diffuse parietal atheroma with no plaques or stenosis present.
Normal ultrasonographic pattern of the arterial wall over all the arterial tree from the 
common femorals till the feet branches.
Perfect patency of the common, superficial and deep femoral arteries with normal color 
signal and normal spectral pattern with preserved diastolic components consistent with 
good arterial elasticity.
At the knee level, normally patent popliteal and tibio-fibular branches.
Normal signal and pattern of the tibio-fibular branches including the ankle regions and the dorsalis pedis.

CONCLUSION:  Normal arterial study of the lower limbs.

('Doppler Carotids TRIPLEX STUDY OF THE CERVICO-ENCEPHALIC ARTERIES1','TRIPLEX STUDY OF THE CERVICO-ENCEPHALIC ARTERIES:','CLINICAL:

FINDINGS:

Mild atheromatous overload of the carotid arterial wall on both sides more at the left bifurcation 
where a 1.2 mm thick long atheromatous plaque was seen.
No evidence of any stenotic plaque seen on all the arteries including the main, internal and external 
carotids and the vertebral arteries as well.
Normal spectral study on the left with normal velocity at the internal carotid.
The left internal carotid showed a mildly reduced velocity at 75 cm / sec against 135 cm / sec on the left.
Also the right ICA spectrum showed a mildly high resistence pattern with some reduction of the diastole 
which can but not necessarily indicate repeated micro-embolic attacks on the right distal cerebral bed.
Normal caliber and spectra of both vertebral arteries.


CONCLUSION:  
Suspicion of micro-embolic attackes of the distal right internal carotid bed.

('Doppler v.legs TRIPLEX VENOUS STUDY OF THE LOWER LIMBS1','TRIPLEX VENOUS STUDY OF THE LOWER LIMBS:','CLINICAL:

FINDINGS:

Normal ultrasonographic pattern of the venous wall and valves.
Perfect patency of the common, superficial and deep femoral veins with normal color signal 
spontaneously and on proximal compression augmentation test.
Normal greater saphenous cross as well.
At the knee level, normally patent popliteal vein with normal lesser saphenous flow as well.
No signal and pattern abnormalities of the tibio-fibular veins neither; they preserve a normal 
flow and signals.
Good patency of the proximal part of the greater saphenous vein.

Presence of many enlarged tortuous varicose veins of the leg mainly medially, reaching a maximum diameter
of ** mm, blood inside is slow but no evidence of thrombosis.
Large perforators are connecting these varicose to the deep venous circulation.


CONCLUSION:  
Normal study with no signs of superficial and deep venous thrombosis.
                    Evidence of leg varicose veins with incompetent large perforators.

FINDINGS:

Couple inflammatory inguino-femoral lymphadenopathies present the longest 24 mm long.  
Normally patent greater saphenous cross with moderately dilated 6.8 mm pre-vavular caliber but with a competent valve and no obvious reflux during valsalva. Even the lateral accessory saphenous looked mildly dilated 4.2 mm. No big varicose branches noted at the thigh.  
Multiple superficial tortuous varicose branches present along the whole leg and  around the knee looking connected to the GSV bed. 2 Large incompetent perforators noted at 5 cm and 20 cm from medial malleolus showing   reversed flow. Thin competent small saphenous vein. 
Perfect patency of the common superficial and deep femoral veins with normal color signal   spontaneously and on proximal compression augmentation test.  
At the knee level normally patent popliteal vein with no signal and pattern abnormalities of the tibio-fibular veins.    


CONCLUSION:  

Marked superficial varicose veins of the right leg with 2 large incompetent perforators.
